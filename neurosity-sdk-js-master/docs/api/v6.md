title: Migrating from v5 to v6
---

The new version 6 of the SDK is mostly backwards compatible with v5.

There are 3 changes.

### 1. Import name change

The most important change is the new renamed npm package and the name of the main SDK class.

Before:

```ts
import { Notion } from "@neurosity/notion";

const notion = new Notion();
```

After:

```ts
import { Neurosity } from "@neurosity/sdk";

const neurosity = new Neurosity();
```

### 2. Single metric/label pair

Previously, the following function could accept multiple labels:

Before:

```ts
neurosity.brainwaves("raw", "psd", "powerByBand");
neurosity.kinesis("push", "pull");
neurosity.predictions("push", "pull");
```

In v6, these functions only accept 1 label.

After:

```ts
neurosity.brainwaves("raw");
neurosity.kinesis("pull");
neurosity.predictions("push");
```

To get the same behavior as before, you can merge the streams:

```ts
import { merge } from "rxjs";

merge(
  neurosity.brainwaves("raw"),
  neurosity.brainwaves("psd"),
  neurosity.brainwaves("powerByBand")
).subscribe((brainwaves) => {
  //
});
```

### 3. Removed Local Mode

We've removed the following local mode functions in favor of the new Bluetooth support:

```ts
neurosity.enableLocalMode();
neurosity.isLocalMode();
```

If you are interested in supporting Bluetooth for your app, you can check out the [Bluetooth tutorial](/docs/api/streaming).
