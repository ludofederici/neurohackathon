Getting great signal is very important. To learn about how to get great signal, check out [this getting started guide here](https://support.neurosity.co/hc/en-us/sections/360007270652-Getting-started).

Understanding when a device has good enough signal quality can be the difference between magic and failiure. Understanding when an electrode is air gapped from a head is very important. You may always use the console for signal checking, but if you want to have a put on the head experience, then you should probably check signal quality. To measure is to know.

We'll be adding more information on ensuring great signal quality to the knowledge base soon. In the meantime: Green signal quality is ideal. Orange means there is room for improvement. Gray means the electrode is not making proper contact. Some things that help go from orange to green are:

- Ensuring enough pressure is applied to the head. This can be accomplished by making sure the headset is sitting at the right angle: roughly 45 degrees. Additionally, extend the headset to your ideal length.

- Ensuring the electrodes are going through the hair. This can be accomplished by slightly combing the headset in a circular motion until you can feel the electrode prongs.
